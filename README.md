# ECF addons
Just some stuff I felt like doing for ECF/Juwl Characters.

**Proto Slot Icons** must be placed above all characters made for ECF so the mod can grab the sprite key for the Slot Machine. (mentioned in the mod description, as well, just to make sure of it)
**Ray HCZ Glide** and **S3C Compat** should be loaded above the ECF mod itself, but *can* be loaded above or below characters. Issues could occur depending on what an ECF character does, but are fine with Juwl Characters.
